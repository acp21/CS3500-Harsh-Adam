#HTML

Our html pages are based on bootstrap.

#CSS

CSS is on top of our bootstrap html pages to give the sight a more custom look.

#JS

JS is used to validate all the forms on our website, and animate everything on the web page. Moreover, we use ajax calls to interface with a web api.

#PHP

We used php to manage user authentification across the website. Additionally, php is used to create a user session in the back end data base in order to track anytime a user presses an add to cart button.
We used this data base back end user tracking to have site wide shopping cart for the website.
