                <b class="project">A Project for WMU CS 3500</b><br><br>
                <h2>TEAM 10</h2>
                <p class="project">Our project was designed around making a website for the fictional company "Atlas Corporation."
                  The fictional company sells many tech related items, such as phones and computers.  We started by designing a theme
                  for the comapny, an overall look and feel we wanted the website to have. As you can see, the entire site follows a 
                  light blue color scheme. This was done to help the website fit together and feel like a cohesive whole. The technology 
                  company was chosen for the website as it allows us room to grow and develop a backend for the future, such as the log in
                  features that currently only have a front end. Overall the project went very well.
